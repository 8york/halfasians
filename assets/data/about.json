    "About": "Halfasian is half <a href='https://www.instagram.com/8yorki/' target='_blank'>8york</a> and half <a href='https://www.instagram.com/dcstylefylez/?hl=en' target='_blank'>DC</a>. The first meeting was by chance at a traffic light sometime in the 2000s with different impressions of each other. Soon turned out that they had an array of mutual friends and acquaintances and lived around the corner from each other. Being in a small sub-tropic town, they both attended the same social events and ran into each other but never went beyond greetings and small talk about other people. DC and 8york never crossed the threshold from someone I know to be friends. Distanced each other for a few years since 2011 and rarely heard about each other from until one day they became neighbours again, living around the corner from each other again, away from the traffic lights of their first meeting. In 2017, helped by being a strangers in a new town, DC and 8york talked about the idea of forming a band, but not a musical one. But talked about writing a song only about oysters. However, in 2018, they ended up writing 6 songs about random people or stories instead of oysters for an exhibition they were invited to be part of. Halfasian is curious about things and people by nature, and this curiosity sometimes leads to a healthy addiction, which fuels new ideas for another song. Halfasian is an extension of our gossipie conversations without ambitions",
