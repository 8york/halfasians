    "About": "Halfasian is half 8york and half DC. The first meeting was by chance at a traffic light sometime in the 2000s with different impressions of each other. It soon turned out that they had an array of mutual friends and acquaintances and lived around the corner from each other. They frequently attended the same social events but never went beyond greetings and small talk about mutual acquaintances. They never crossed the threshold from someone I know to someone I really know. They were geographically distanced for a few years since 2011 and rarely heard about each other from mutual friends until one day they started living around the corner from each other again, away from the traffic lights of their first meeting. In 2017, they talked about the idea of forming a band, but not a musical one, and always talked about writing a song about oysters. However, in 2018, they ended up writing many songs about random people or stories instead of oysters. Halfasian is curious about things and people by nature, and this curiosity sometimes leads to a healthy addiction, which fuels new ideas for another song.",
